# Silent Wars: A Fully On-Chain Autonomous World Game

## Overview

**Silent Wars** is a fully on-chain game designed to explore the dynamics of censorship resistance, regulatory compliance, and speculative narratives within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By engaging in on-chain governance, players can influence the direction of the game and experience the complexities of real-world DAO and community governance.

## Why Silent Wars?

1. **Censorship Resistance**: In the current crypto landscape, censorship resistance is crucial. The game is inspired by the challenges faced by crypto coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing players with a deep understanding of the importance of maintaining a censorship-resistant environment.

2. **Learning On-Chain Governance**: The game offers players an opportunity to learn and experience on-chain governance firsthand. By participating in the governance process, players can better understand how DAOs and communities operate in the real world, effectively reducing the cost of user education.

3. **Public Goods Value**:
   - Silent Wars is built on an interoperable, permissionless value-generating infrastructure designed with positive-sum principles.
   - This framework can serve as the foundation for the development of new autonomous worlds and contribute to the security and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.

## How It Works

### Beginning the Game

- Players join Silent Wars by staking $ETH. This initial staking process is crucial for determining the direction of the game's governance on censorship resistance.
- Players can choose from three factions:
  - **Cypherpunk**: Advocates for anti-censorship and privacy.
  - **Moloch**: Supports regulatory compliance and the recognition of ETH as digital gold.
  - **Memecoin**: Prioritizes storytelling and price speculation, disregarding regulatory concerns.
- The faction’s resources and member count are hidden on-chain when players make their choice, ensuring an element of strategy and mystery.

### Resource Acquisition

- Players must stake ETH to earn staking points, which are used to gather resources (farming), battle monsters (fighting), and compete against other players (PvP).
- These activities are essential for building power within the game and advancing your faction’s goals.

### Governance

- Staking also provides players with **voting power**. This voting power is used during random in-game events where community decisions must be made.
- The governance system mirrors real-world DAOs, requiring players to persuade or strategize with other community members to vote in favor of decisions that benefit their faction’s direction.

# Tech Stack

This project uses reactJS and PhaserJS (game animations) for the frontend and can be accessed from Telegram mini-app or browsers. Login is done with Dynamic. We have also integrated MACI voting mechanics within the game. For the smart contracts, we have used remix for the multi chain deployment. Players can either stake or use World ID for ensuring a fairer voting.

For the gameplay design, we’ve incorporated game designs from many trending traditional games, and. we designed our game with the Public Goods values in mind. We want players to be constantly faced with options, and these options are in most times best be done with collective minds.
