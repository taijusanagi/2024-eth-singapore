# Silent Wars: A Fully On-Chain Autonomous World Game

## Overview

**Silent Wars** is a fully on-chain game designed to explore the dynamics of censorship resistance, regulatory compliance, and speculative narratives within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By engaging in on-chain governance, players can influence the direction of the game and experience the complexities of real-world DAO and community governance.

## Why Silent Wars?

1. **Censorship Resistance**: In the current crypto landscape, censorship resistance is crucial. The game is inspired by the challenges faced by crypto coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing players with a deep understanding of the importance of maintaining a censorship-resistant environment.

2. **Learning On-Chain Governance**: The game offers players an opportunity to learn and experience on-chain governance firsthand. By participating in the governance process, players can better understand how DAOs and communities operate in the real world, effectively reducing the cost of user education.

3. **Public Goods Value**: 
    - Silent Wars is built on an interoperable, permissionless value-generating infrastructure designed with positive-sum principles.
    - This framework can serve as the foundation for the development of new autonomous worlds and contribute to the security and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.

## How It Works

### Beginning the Game
- Players join Silent Wars by staking $ETH, $USDC, or $meme. This initial staking process is crucial for determining the direction of the game's governance on censorship resistance.
- Players can choose from three factions:
  - **Cypherpunk**: Advocates for anti-censorship and privacy.
  - **Moloch**: Supports regulatory compliance and the recognition of ETH as digital gold.
  - **Memecoin**: Prioritizes storytelling and price speculation, disregarding regulatory concerns.
- The faction’s resources and member count are hidden on-chain when players make their choice, ensuring an element of strategy and mystery.

### Resource Acquisition
- Players must stake ETH to earn staking points, which are used to gather resources (farming), battle monsters (fighting), and compete against other players (PvP).
- These activities are essential for building power within the game and advancing your faction’s goals.

### Governance
- Staking also provides players with **voting power**. This voting power is used during random in-game events where community decisions must be made.
- The governance system mirrors real-world DAOs, requiring players to persuade or strategize with other community members to vote in favor of decisions that benefit their faction’s direction.
